# picoCTF_2023_WriteUps
I participated in the 2023 PicoCTF challenge. These are solutions to the challenges I solved during the competition as well as those I solved after the competition.
This competition was organised by Carnegie Mellon University and ran from Mar 15, 2023, to Mar 29 2023. 
I competed in the global, undergraduate and African leaderboard.
